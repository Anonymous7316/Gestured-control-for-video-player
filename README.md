## **Introduction**
 *Gesture control is a breakthrough feature that give you full control of your devices, with just your hand gestures. It’s a whole new way of interacting with your device.Gestures allow the user to handle multiple points of input and even define several parameters at once. They are therefore, a more neutral form of communication.The advantages of gestures are :-*
 1. Immediate and Powerful Interaction: Unlike traditional buttons and menus, gestures do not interrupt the user’s activity by forcing him to move his hand to the    location of command.
 2. Intuitiveness and enjoyability: Gestures feel very natural; to perform since they mirror our experiences in the real world.

## **Python Packages used in Project:**  

**1. OpenCV:**
  *The role of OpenCV is to count number of fingers, thresholding, perform convex hull (a dynamic stretchable envelope that wraps around the object of interest) and for segmentation of the object. OpenCV also acts as computer vision, signal & geometry processing.*
  
**2. Numpy:**
  *Numerical Python or NumPy is being used for manipulation of data and computations on that data.*
  
## **Working:**
